title: "Transmission?"
teaching: 5
exercises: 20
questions:
- "In which cases is transmission likely?"
objectives:
- "Compare and interpret the different data sources."
keypoints:
- "SNP phylogeny, pangenome analysis and metadata can convey different messages"
- "Human interpretation is often needed to weigh the different information sources."
---




Compare the pangenome clustering with the clustering based on SNPs or gene presence/absence and with the data from epidemiological contact tracing:

- Patient A1 - sample ERR029207
- Patient A2 - sample ERR029206
- Patient A3 - sample ERR026478


- Patient B1 - sample ERR026474 
- Patient B2 - sample ERR026473


- Patient C1 - sample ERR026481
- Patient C2 - sample ERR026482

Which transmission events are affirmed by the genomic data? Which ones partially or not?
