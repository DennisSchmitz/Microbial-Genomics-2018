teaching: 15
exercises: 90
questions:
- "How can a phylogenetic tree be produced?"
objectives:
- "Map reads against a reference genome"
- "Extract single nucleotide polymorphisms"
- "Establish a phylogenetic tree from the SNP data"
keypoints:
- "Single nucleotide polymorphisms can be identified by mapping reads to a reference genome"
- "Parameters for the analysis have to be selected based on expected outcomes for this organism"
- "Concatenation of SNPs helps to reduce analysis volume"    
- "Phylogenetic trees can be annotated with a bracket syntax in Newick format"
