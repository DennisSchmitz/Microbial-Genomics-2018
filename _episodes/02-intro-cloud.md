title: "Logging onto Cloud"
teaching: 5
exercises: 5
questions:
- How do I connect to an AWS instance?
objectives:
- Log onto to a running instance
- Log off from a running instance
keypoints:
- You can use one set of log-in credentials for many instances
- Logging off an instance is not the same as turning off an instance

## Important Note

This lesson covers how to log into, and out of, an *already running* Amazon instance.


## Background to AWS

Setting up a new AWS instance requires a credit card, an AWS account, and up to
a day of verification time, but you've already spent most of this workshop working in the cloud!
To save time, your instructor launched a remote computer (instance) for you prior
to the workshop, and connected it to our lesson data. You've already logged into it at
least once, but now that you're more comfortable with the command line, lets go back and talk about how it all works.


We have a pre-configured copy of the data needed for this workshop that is always available
to attach to a new instance on Amazon, as long as you have an account, and the log-in credentials to open it.

To access the pre-configured workshop data, you'll need to use our log-in credentials (user name and password):

**Log-in Credentials (case-sensitive!)**

- Username: dcuser
- Password: data4Carp

But first, you need a place to log *into*! To find the instance that's attached to that data,
you'll need something called an IP address. Your instructor should have given this to you
at the beginning of the workshop.

An IP address is essentially the numerical version of a web address like www.amazon.com

Recall that cloud computing is about choice. You can rent just a single processor on a large computer
for a small project, or you can rent hundreds of processors spread across multiple computers for
a large project. In either case, once you rent the collection of processors, Amazon will
present your rental to you as if it was a single computer. So, the physical computers that host your
instances don't really move, *but* every time you launch a new instance, it will have a new IP address.

So, each time you launch a new instance, the *IP address* changes, but your *Log-in Credentials* don't have to.

## Connection Protocols

We will use a protocol called Secure Shell (SSH) that, as the name implies, provides you
with a secure way to use a [shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice). In our case,
the shell will be running on a remote machine. This protocol is available for every
operating system, but sometimes requires additional software.

## Logging onto a cloud instance

**Please select the platform you wish to use for the exercises: <select id="id_platform" name="platformlist" onchange="change_content_by_platform('id_platform');return false;"><option value="aws_unix" id="id_aws_unix" selected> AWS_UNIX </option><option value="aws_win" id="id_aws_win" selected> AWS_Windows </option></select>**
