Visualization is frequently used to aid the interpretation of complex datasets. Within microbial genomics, visualizing the relationships between multiple genomes as a tree provides a framework onto which associated data (geographical, temporal, phenotypic and epidemiological) are added to generate hypotheses and to explore the dynamics of the system under investigation.

Upload the newick tree produced by SNP typing and the meta data [file](files/meta.csv) to `https://microreact.org/.`

Explore the location, time and further meta data.

Repeat this with the second tree based on the presence/absence of genes.
