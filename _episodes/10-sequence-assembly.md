Sequence assembly means the alignment and merging of reads in order to reconstruct the original sequence.
There are a few ways to keep cloud processes running in the background. Many times when we refer to a background process we are talking about what is described at this tutorial - running a command and returning to shell prompt. Here we describe a program that will allow us to run our entire shell and keep that process running even if we disconnect.

## Starting and attaching to screen sessions

### Starting a new session

You can start a session and give it a descriptive name:

~~~
screen -S assembly
~~~
{: .bash}

This creates a session with the name ‘assembly’

As you work, this session will stay active until you close this session. Even if you disconnect from your machine, the jobs you start in this session will run till completion.


## Sequence assembly

We will talk about sequence assembly in a separate [lecture](../data/lectureAssembly.pdf)

The assembler we will run is SPAdes. SPAdes generates a final assembly from multiple kmers. A list of kmers is automatically selected by SPAdes using the maximum read length of the input data, and each individual kmer contributes to the final assembly. To run SPAdes we will use the spades.py command with the --careful option to minimize the number of mismatches in the contigs, -o for the output folder, -1 for the path to the forward reads, -2 for the path to the reverse reads, and -s for the path to the singles reads. If desired, a list of kmers can be specified with the -k flag which will override automatic kmer selection.


## Assembly (over night)

Because assembly of each genome might take a couple of hours, we will run all assemblies in a loop overnight. It is important to run them within the screen session or else the process will be terminated if we disconnect from the machine. 

Preparation
~~~
cd ~/dc_workshop/data
mkdir ../results/assembly
~~~
{: .bash}

We can start the loop with the assemblies

~~~
for sample in ERR026473 ERR026474 ERR026478 ERR026481 ERR026482 ERR029206 ERR029207
  do
  spades.py  --careful -1 "$sample"_1.fastq.gz -2 "$sample"_2.fastq.gz -o ../results/assembly/"$sample"
  done
~~~
{: .bash}

**Detach session (process keeps running in background)**

You can detach from a session by pressing `control + a` followed by `d` (for detach) on your keyboard. 

You can now safely log out from your machine. The assembly will keep on running.

At the moment, all samples are called contigs.fasta. This is not ideal. In the next episode we will rename the assembled contigs before processing them further.
