title: "Annotation"
teaching: 20
exercises: 45
questions:
- "How are proteins predicted from a DNA sequence?"
objectives:
- "Search for open reading frames"
- "Predict a protein from an open reading frame"
- "Annotate a genome"
keypoints:
- "Genome annotation includes prediction of protein-coding genes, as well as other functional genome units"
- "It often starts by identifying open reading frames"
- "Predicted sequences are further analysed with BLAST"
- "Larger DNA sequences or genomes require automated prediction and annotation"
